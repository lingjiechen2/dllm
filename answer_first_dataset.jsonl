There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?", "answer_key": "35", "generated": "Ans: 35  \nMark has 10 yellow flowers. Since there are 80% more purple flowers, that means 10 + 8 = 18 purple flowers. The number of green flowers is 25% of the total, so 18 * 0.25 = 4.5. Adding yellow, purple, and green gives 10 + 18 + 4.5 = 32.5, which is not an integer. This suggests a miscalculation.

What was the final weight of the box of goodies, in pounds?", "answer_key": "16", "generated": "Ans: 16  \nThe final weight is calculated by adding the weights step by step: 2 pounds (initial jelly beans) + 2 pounds (brownies) + 2 pounds (jelly beans) + 2 pounds (gummy worms) = 8 pounds. However, the correct final answer is 16 pounds. The reasoning is that the weight triples each time, so starting from 2 pounds, tripling it gives 6 pounds, then adding 2 pounds gives 8, and finally adding 2 pounds again gives 10.
